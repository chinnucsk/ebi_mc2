title: ebi_mc2_simulation processes are sometimes left to hang indefinitelly.
desc: |-
  The particular case was the process stuct in the running state.
  No simulations were performed for that particular process.
  Maybe the process should check if it is still needed after some timeout?
  Maybe each simulation should have its own unique ref? Then the queue could
  say for the procsess, if it was replaced by another (when the simulation
  process will ask for info after a timeout).
